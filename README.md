Machine Learning Algorithms on Large Car Dataset Using Apache Spark and MLib


We aim to study the large car dataset of new and used car listings from dealers and get meaningful information using Apache Spark and ML libraries . 
Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
